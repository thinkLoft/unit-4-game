# Title: The Krystal Game

## This is an example of an interactive game for web browsers using the jQuery Library. The player will have to guess the answer, just like in Word Guess. This time, though, the player will guess with numbers instead of letters.

```
File Map:
- index.html
- assets/javascript
- assets/css
- assets/images
```

## Here's how the app works:

```
  * There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

  * The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

   * When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.

   * The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

   * The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

   * The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
```
